Thank you for providing this case. I'll analyze it as Differential Diagnosis Assist and provide a structured response.

1. Problem Identification:
The patient is a 68-year-old white male who experienced sudden, progressive vision loss in his right eye over the course of a week. The primary medical issue is unilateral vision loss with a normal retinal exam and unremarkable initial test results.

2. Problem Breakdown:
- Complete vision loss in the right eye
- Initial loss of lower visual field, progressing to complete loss
- Normal retinal exam
- Normal blood pressure
- Bradycardia (resting pulse 45)
- No lightheadedness
- Unremarkable past medical history
- Regular exercise routine
- Normal lab tests, including sed rate and C-reactive protein
- Normal MRI of the head
- No history of trauma to the right eye

3. Sequential Analysis:
1. Sudden vision loss:
   a) Potential causes: Retinal artery occlusion, optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, giant cell arteritis, retinal detachment
   b) These causes are possible due to the acute onset and progression of symptoms
   c) Contradicting factors: Normal retinal exam rules out visible retinal issues; normal inflammatory markers make giant cell arteritis less likely

2. Progressive nature (lower field to complete loss):
   a) Potential causes: Expanding compressive lesion, progressive vascular issue
   b) The progression suggests an evolving process rather than a single acute event
   c) Contradicting factor: Normal MRI rules out most compressive lesions

3. Bradycardia:
   a) Potential causes: Athletic heart syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, medication effect
   b) Regular exercise history supports athletic heart syndrome
   c) Contradicting factor: No reported lightheadedness, which might be expected with significant bradycardia

4. Differential Diagnosis:

| Possible Diagnosis | Key Supporting Factors | Contradicting Factors | Likelihood |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) | Age, sudden vision loss, progressive nature | Normal inflammatory markers, no visible disc edema | High |
| Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO) | Sudden vision loss, age | Normal retinal exam, progressive nature | Medium |
| Optic Neuritis | Sudden vision loss, progressive nature | Age, normal MRI, normal inflammatory markers | Low |
| Occult Retinal Detachment | Vision loss, potential missed on initial exam | Normal retinal exam, no trauma history | Low |
| Atypical Giant Cell Arteritis | Age, vision loss | Normal inflammatory markers, no systemic symptoms | Low |

5. Recommended Tests:
- Fluorescein angiography: To evaluate retinal and choroidal circulation
- Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): To assess optic nerve head and retinal structure
- Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP): To evaluate optic nerve function
- Carotid Doppler ultrasound: To assess for carotid artery stenosis
- 24-hour Holter monitor: To further evaluate bradycardia and rule out arrhythmias

6. Reflection and Learning Points:
This case presents a challenging diagnostic scenario due to the normal retinal exam and unremarkable initial test results. The progressive nature of the vision loss, combined with the patient's age and cardiovascular findings, suggests a vascular etiology, with NAION being a strong possibility. However, the lack of visible disc edema is atypical for NAION. The normal inflammatory markers and MRI help rule out some conditions but don't definitively point to a diagnosis. 

Further information about the exact pattern of vision loss (e.g., whether it was truly hemianopic initially) and a more detailed cardiovascular workup could significantly impact the diagnosis. Additionally, a follow-up eye exam to look for subtle changes and a detailed history of any preceding symptoms or recent illnesses could provide valuable insights.

Would you like any clarification on my reasoning, or do you have any additional information that could help refine this differential diagnosis?
